# Multiple legal and licensing requirements

<div class="risk-rounded-box high">High</div>

topic for the question **Does the application have legal and/or licensing requirements?**.

If the application is deployed with a specific licensing needed this can
affect the deployment of the application and running it.

It should be checked what kind of license is needed and if this license can
be injected into Kubernetes deployment or if it is a must to deploy the
application on a specific server to start it.

This risk needs to be addressed before deploying any production-grade
services with this gap.
