# Separate internal support team, separate from the development team, with little interaction between the teams

**Risk Level**: High

Having support operations split between disparate teams with little interaction will ultimately slow down the support process and incident handling. 
It is strongly recommended to look at establishing a DevOps model for team structure and application operations. While there is no “black and white”, meaning this is a gradual phase over and learning process, a DevOps team setup will allow you to increase support quality as well as lower time elapsed to fix errors and deploy changes.

Among others, Red Hat offers the “DevOps Culture and Practice Enablement” [1] training course to experience a DevOps approach first hand. Additionally, there is a recent book publication “DevOps Culture and Practice with OpenShift” [2] that provides deep insights into this approach and its benefits.
