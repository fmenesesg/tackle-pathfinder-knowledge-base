# Not tracked

**Risk Level**: High

Not tracking this time represents a lack of improvement in the application life cycle in general, but could have an impact on the benefits for this application in a container orchestration platform, such as Kubernetes.
Software Delivery Performance [1] defines the Lead Time metric as the total time it takes for work to move through the value stream, from the moment the work is requested to the time it’s delivered. Optimizing this value the value stream of the application could impact successfully in the general overview of the application.
Kubernetes does not include specific features or capabilities focused to optimize that metric, however the platform itself allows to create new value streams based on CICD pipelines, optimization resources, automating processes and so on that could have a huge impact on that metric.

Missing this metric at all means a “High” risk because we could not identify how this application could be improved in the container orchestration platform. It should check or review the main benefits for this application on the new platform.

Using tools like Pelorus [2] will help to get that metrics, among others, to optimize the value stream of the application.
