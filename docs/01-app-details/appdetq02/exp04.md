# Multiple teams provide support using an established escalation model

topic for the question **How is the application supported in production?**.

Production support and operations follow the traditional separation between
Development and Operation, with an established escalation process.

While this is not a blocker to move applications to containers, the adoption of
Kubernetes as container orchestration platform enables an organisation to
embrace DevOps practices[1].

While the technical aspect of this (such as the container platform, using CI/CD
tooling with a high degree of test automation, etc) is a starting point, the people
and process dimensions are more difficult to change and it will take time. However,
we encourage all Kubernetes users to evaluate the advantages this will bring beyond
the simple adoption of a new technology.

Among others, Red Hat offers the “DevOps Culture and Practice Enablement”[2]
training course to experience a DevOps approach first hand. Additionally, there
is a recent book publication “DevOps Culture and Practice with OpenShift”[3]
that provides deep insights into this approach and its benefits.
