Answers, Risk and Explanations:

* [Unknown](./04-app-observability/appobsq04/exp01.md)
* [Deterministic and predictable real-time execution or control requirements (High)](./04-app-observability/appobsq04/exp02.md)
* [Sensitive to latency (examples: voice applications, high frequency trading applications) (Medium)](./04-app-observability/appobsq04/exp03.md)
* [Constant traffic with a broad range of CPU and memory usage (Medium)](./04-app-observability/appobsq04/exp04.md)
* Intermittent traffic with predictable CPU and memory usage (Low)
* Constant traffic with predictable CPU and memory usage (Low)
