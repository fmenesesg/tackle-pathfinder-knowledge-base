# How is the application tested?

Answers, Risk and Explanations:

* [Unknown](./05-app-cross-cutting-concerns/appcccq01/exp01.md)
* [No testing or minimal manual testing only (High)](./05-app-cross-cutting-concerns/appcccq01/exp02.md)
* [Minimal automated testing, focused on the user interface (Medium)](./05-app-cross-cutting-concerns/appcccq01/exp03.md)
* [Some automated unit and regression testing, basic CI/CD pipeline testing; modern test practices are not followed (Medium)](./05-app-cross-cutting-concerns/appcccq01/exp04.md)
* Highly repeatable automated testing (examples: unit, integration, smoke tests) before deploying to production; modern test practices are followed (Low)
* Chaos engineering approach, constant testing in production (example: A/B testing + experimentation) (Low)
