topic for the question **How much time passes from when code is committed until the application is deployed to production?**.

The current knowledge or experience does not allow us to measure the risk of this
question. There is a lack of knowledge or experience that could have (or not) an
impact on the next stages of the migration and modernization project. It is recommended
to identify the teams, team leads or stakeholders with the knowledge or experience
to answer the question, to measure it.
