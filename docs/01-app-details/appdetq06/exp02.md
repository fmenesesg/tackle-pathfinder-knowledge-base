# Multiple legal and licensing requirements

**Risk Level**: High

If the application is deployed with a specific licensing needed this can affect the deployment of
the application and running it.

It should be checked what kind of license is needed and if this license can be injected into Kubernetes
deployment or if it is a must to deploy the application on a specific server to start it.

This risk needs to be addressed before deploying any production-grade services with this gap.
