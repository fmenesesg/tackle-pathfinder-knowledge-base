# Which model best describes the application architecture?

Answers, Risk and Explanations:

* [Unknown](./01-app-details/appdetq07/exp01.md)
* [Massive monolith (high memory and CPU usage), singleton deployment, vertical scale only (Medium)](./01-app-details/appdetq07/exp02.md)
* [Massive monolith (high memory and CPU usage), non-singleton deployment, complex to scale horizontally (Medium)](./01-app-details/appdetq07/exp03.md)
* [Complex monolith, strict runtime dependency startup order, non-resilient architecture (Medium)](./01-app-details/appdetq07/exp04.md)
* Resilient monolith (examples: retries, circuit breakers) (Low)
* Independently deployable components (Low)
